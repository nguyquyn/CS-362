                    <br></br>The classic northern dogs, Siberian huskies are friendly 
                    and intelligent but somewhat independent and stubborn. They 
                    thrive on human company, but need firm, gentle training from puppyhood.

                    <br></br>Highly intelligent and sociable, the cockapoo dog

                    <br></br>Because golden retrievers are easy to please, they respond positively to 
                    obedience training. They complement this trait by being playful, affectionate 
                    and even-tempered.
